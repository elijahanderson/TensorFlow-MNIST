# TensorFlow-MNIST
Last semester, I implemented a from-scratch neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
This semester, my goal is to become fluent with the machine learning framework TensorFlow. I hope to have at least 3
different machine learning projects up on my github using the framework by the time I start my internship at Cerner.

The first project will be a simple one to get a feel for the framework and start to really understand how to
manipulate and interact with the code rather than just stealing others' code. This project will be a tensorflow
implementation of the project I worked on last semester, classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. I
will be using a tutorial by Justin Francis from a little over a year ago:

I chose this one because it is visually appealing and interactive, so I really learn rather than just copying code.
